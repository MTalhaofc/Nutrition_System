This recipe is as close as I have ever found to hers.  They are delicious with pork or beef gravy and in stew.  Yummy!

54,8476,2509,CAROLYN INCH,5,"I made this recipe for 16 coworkers.  I doubled the amounts of the ingrediants hoping to get 4 loaves.  I only got 3 loaaves and the batter was hard to stir when it came to adding the walnuts and apples.  The end result was excellent and the bread was consumed in a matter of minutes.  Everybody loved the bread but they love it when anybody brings in homemade snacks.  I was very happy with the taste of the bread.

59,7205,2178,troyh,3,I think I cooked the chicken too long so the breadcrumb mixture became a little too crispy. Be careful. I'd also increase the ratio of seasonings to chicken as I used a little less than was specified and had just enough mixture to cover the chicken.,2000-10-06T12:20:48Z,2000-10-06T12:20:48Z

1/2 C soy milk in place of the 1/2 C milk.
1/2 C Egg Beaters in place of the 2 eggs.
1/4 C ""I can't believe it's not Butter"" in place of Butter.

And not that it would make a difference but I baked it in a stoneware loaf pan and it came out beautiful.  Very Good!

Best to use real grated fresh pamesan cheese, the bulk grated stuff imparts a grittyness that I did not find pleasent.

The flavor is wonderful and the texture is slightly lighter than traditional pumpin pie, I suspect due to the substitution of light cream instead of canned milk.

This was very tasty, though not as rich as I might have guessed.  It was somewhat  sweeter than I normally like, but I did not leave any in the bowl. The upside down presentation is showy.  I recommend some very rich ice cream as a topping or side dish (Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla  Ice Cream fills the bill in my neck of the woods).  Fun and tasty.

In fact there are very many other stuffed vegetable dishes in the Turkish Cuisine, such as eggplants, arthichokes, marrow(zuccihini) and its blossoms, potatoes etc.  This term, stuffed, is also used for dishes where chicken, turkey and the like are stuffed with various ingredients, mainly rice, before cooking usually in the oven.",2000-11-28T13:20:00Z,2000-11-28T13:20:00Z

170,607,3731,Wei-Li Eastlake,5,"The French Onion soup recipe is one of the most popular dish served at the Famous Barr (also part of the May Dept store group) restaurants found in St.Louis.   Based on my travels to the various countries including Europe, Asia and US, this version of French Onion soup is one of the best I've had. My husband who is from London just loves this recipe.

It is robust and hearty in beef and onion flavour and quite thick so you can enjoy this as a meal in itself (you might say it's great comfort food).  Be sure to use the broiler until the cheese bubbles and turns golden brown over the French bread. Tip: Try to use the fresh French bread which is a bit chewy in texture.
